# Fish Fusion Project

In this project, you are going to build a purchasing pipeline for a bargain fish restaurant in your city.

There are 3 different actors in this system, and you will write functions in multiple modules of code to have them share data, and in the end, the restaurant will make its final purchases.

The project source code link will be available in the LMS once you begin the assessment.
