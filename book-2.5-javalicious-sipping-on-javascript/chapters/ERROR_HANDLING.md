### Error Handling in Java vs. JavaScript

### Key Differences
- **Java:** Has both checked and unchecked exceptions. Checked exceptions must be caught or declared in the method signature, like `IOException` or `SQLException`. Unchecked exceptions, like `ArithmeticException`, are not required to be caught at compile time but may occur during runtime.
- **JavaScript:** JavaScript only has unchecked exceptions. You can throw exceptions using `throw`, and handling them with `try/catch` is optional.

#### **Java Code:**
```java
import java.io.*;

class YardSale {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Since "items.txt" does not exist, FileReader will raise 
            // a checked exception (FileNotFoundException).
            // The code author is required to surround this call 
            // in a try/catch block to handle the exception.
            FileReader reader = new FileReader("items.txt");
            reader.read();
            reader.close();
        } catch (IOException e) { // Must handle IOException
            System.out.println("File reading error: " + e);
        }
    }
}
```

#### **JavaScript Code:**
```javascript
function yardSale() {
    // Simulating a yard sale transaction
    let items = ["Old Lamp", "Bike", "Books"];
    let buyer = null; // Buyer hasn't shown up yet

    // Attempt to call a method on the null buyer object
    buyer.buy(items[0]); 
}

try {
    yardSale();
} catch (e) {
    console.log("Exception caught: " + e.message); // Catching exception is optional
}
```

#### **Open-Ended Questions:**
1. **Java:** What happens when you don't surround `new FileReader` in the `YardSale` class in a try/catch block? What is the benefit of forcing developers to handle checked exceptions at compile time?

2. **JavaScript:** What happens when you don't surround `yardSale()` function call in a try/catch block? What risks might arise from JavaScript's lack of enforced error handling?

#### **Conclusion:**
Java enforces strict error handling with checked exceptions, promoting robust code but increasing verbosity. JavaScriptâ€™s flexible, unchecked exception system allows for faster development but requires careful attention to prevent runtime errors.
