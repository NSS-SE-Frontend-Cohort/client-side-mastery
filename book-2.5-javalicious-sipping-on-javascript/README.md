# JavaScript for JAVA developers

In this book, you will explore how JavaScript differs from the language you are already familiar with (Java). The content assumes proficiency with the java concepts covered in the software engineering NSS course. 

If you're feeling a bit rusty on Java concepts, don't worry! This can serve as a valuable refresher while you learn about the most widely used programming language of the internet JavaScript.

## How to use LLMs (ChatGPT) to enhance, not hinder, your learning
It's perfectly fine to use LLMs to confirm your understanding of a concept or ask for an explanation of complex ideas, but it's important not to rely on them to simply provide answers. Instead, use them as a tool to clarify concepts or gain additional perspectives on how something works. For example, you might use an LLM to verify how strings are handled in JavaScript but not to directly solve coding challenges. This approach encourages deeper learning and problem-solving skills, while still benefiting from the educational value LLMs can offer in understanding or explaining concepts.

## Reading
Be sure to check out these informative articles that delve into the differences between Java and JavaScript. The first article from GeeksforGeeks provides a comprehensive overview of the key distinctions, helping you understand how the two languages differ in terms of syntax, features, and use cases. Meanwhile, the Coursera article offers insights into their respective applications in the tech industry and why each language is important to learn.

The third article compares Java and JavaScript, highlighting key differences in their design, usage, and functionality. The article also discusses scope, execution environments, syntax, functions, datatypes, conditionals. 

The article will provide an excellent introduction to the concepts covered in the book below.

Once you‚Äôve completed all the Core Concepts, take a moment to celebrate! You‚Äôve effectively leveraged your Java knowledge to understand the similarities and differences with JavaScript. Learning new languages in the future will become increasingly easier as you are able to focus on the differences and similarities alone!

Now, you‚Äôre ready to move on to the next part of the course!
